# Introduction to AI

**Chapter 01:**

### What is AI:

Basically the scientist didn't argue on one definition but, we have four categories that we can consider that the AI would be difined in

#### Acting humanly (The Turing test):

The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. the computer will need this:

1. **Natural language processing** to communicate successfully in a human language;
2. **knowledge representation** to store what it knows or hears;
3. **automated reasoning** to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
4. **machine learning** to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

However other researchers have proposed a total turing test which require interacting with objects and people, that's why they add the following tests:

5. **Computer Vision** and speech recognition to perceive the world
6. **Robotics to manipulate** objects and move about.

### Thinking humanly (The cognite modeling approach):

to say that a program think as a human we must first know how humans think.

1. **introspection—trying** to catch our own thoughts as they go by (For example when an idea come to your mind and then it leads to another one and so on and on, until you feel that you get away from the original idea);
2. **psychological experiments—observing** a person in action;
3. **brain imaging—observing** the brain in action (track the brain movement and compare that with the action of its owner).

- If the program’s input–output behavior matches corresponding human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program’s mechanisms could also be operating in humans. (Like the GPS)

#### Thinking Rationally (The laws of thought):

it all starts with arisotle, His **syllogisms** provided patterns for argument
structures that always yielded correct conclusions when given correct premises

_Example:_ if for all x A(X) -> B(X) then if we have A(tariq) by syllogisms we have B(tariq), But tariq must be in lowercase (Idk why)

#### Acting Rational (The rational agent):

- An **Agent** is an entity that acts (do something)
- A **Computer agent** computer agents are expected to do more: operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals.
- A **Rational agent** is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome
